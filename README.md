## Class

Class is a template(blueprint) for creating a object. It contains attributes/properties/datas/state and behavior/methods/actions.

example: `home blueprint/sketch`

## Object

`object is a real entity`, example: `real home`

# Advantages

* Clear structure.
* Reusable.
* DRY code (don't repeat yourself).
* Maintainable/Bug fixing/dedug easy.
* Adoptable.
* Secure,protect infromation through encapsulation.
* Faster development sprint.

# Main pillar of OOP
 1. [Inheritance](https://github.com/code4mk/oop-object-oriented-oop-journey/tree/main/Inheritance) (extends parent class with child class)
 2. [Encapsulation](https://github.com/code4mk/oop-object-oriented-oop-journey/tree/main/encapsulation) (binding properties/method one unit)
 3. [Abstraction](https://github.com/code4mk/oop-object-oriented-oop-journey/tree/main/abstraction) (Hiding implementation)
 4. [Polymorphism](https://github.com/code4mk/oop-object-oriented-oop-journey/tree/main/polymorphism) (Many form)
